- Methods for arranging boxes are commonly used in industrial settings for organizing goods. These methods, such as arranging boxes from largest to smallest or randomly sorting them, are often implemented through programming principles. While these methods are theoretically efficient, practical challenges arise in their real-world application, leading to the use of human resources. However, relying on human labor for such tasks is considered wasteful and challenging to evaluate for efficiency.

# Algorithm

To avoid box overlapping, a box placement simulation has been designed based on the following principles:
### 1 Separate the box vector into three parts and plot to the space(Start at 0,0,0)

### 2 Use three values as the starting point for the next plot

### 3 Check and avoid Collision
