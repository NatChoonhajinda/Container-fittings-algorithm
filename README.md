- Methods for arranging boxes are commonly used in industrial settings for organizing goods. These methods, such as arranging boxes from largest to smallest or randomly sorting them, are often implemented through programming principles. While these methods are theoretically efficient, practical challenges arise in their real-world application, leading to the use of human resources. However, relying on human labor for such tasks is considered wasteful and challenging to evaluate for efficiency.
